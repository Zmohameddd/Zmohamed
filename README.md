I just started my first project course
I'm going to be building a snake game

For week 1, my partner Clarice and I made two programs asking for user input and asking for the ASCII value
first program is scanf() where we use the scanf() capability to ask for input then print
second program we make use of conio library with its khbit and getch() functions to ask for input and print ascii value
